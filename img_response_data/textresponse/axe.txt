The clustered image you've provided has three clearly segmented regions based on colors: blue for the axe head, red for the handle, and green for an area on the handle referred to as the "overstrike" in the clustering, although "overstrike" is not a standard term typically used in the context of axe parts.

Comparing with the regions listed from the original image, the clustering does not fully capture all the important regions as distinctly separate. The blade, cutting edge, cheek, and poll (or butt) are all categorized under the same blue color. These are functionally distinct parts of the axe head; for example, the cutting edge and the poll have different uses. Similarly, the handle has been simplified into one red color region without distinction for the grip, shoulder, or any other specific parts complementary to the axe's handling and usage.

The image appears to be overly simplified with just three regions. Important regions like the cutting edge, cheek, and the poll are not distinguished from the rest of the axe head. On the handle, separate areas for grip and shoulder are not identified.

In conclusion, the clustered image does not adequately separate the different functional regions of the axe. It requires more clusters to distinguish important parts like the cutting edge, the cheek, and the poll on the axe head, as well as the grip and shoulder on the handle. A more detailed clustering would help in better understanding the design and function of the individual parts of the axe.
